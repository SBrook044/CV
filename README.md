##Design
###Index page

The index page will have a basic design in which there will be a header with links to the _cv.hmtl, bio.html, contact.html_ and _a gallery page_. The header will also have my personal logo in the centre with two the links on either side of the logo. The background image will be one from a image from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).

The header links will have hover effects.

There will be text in the middle of the screen with my name and what I am currently doing.

##Began coding _index.html_

To begin I wanted to code the layout of the page so that I could have a base to in which I would experiment with the code until it looks good.

Then started making the button links in the header which will lead to _contact.html, bio.html, cv.html_ and _gallery.htm_.
